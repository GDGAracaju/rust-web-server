# Collaborative Rust Web Server Project - README

Welcome to the **Rust Web Server Project**! This project is focused on building a fully functional web server using the Rust programming language. Our aim is to work together as a team, learn from each other, and deepen our understanding of web development in Rust.

## Project Overview

We are building a simple but robust web server using Rust. The project will cover:

- Setting up a basic HTTP server
- Handling routing and HTTP requests
- Serving static files and dynamic content
- Managing state and sessions
- Integrating with databases
- Security (HTTPS, authentication, etc.)
- Testing and debugging web servers in Rust

We will be using Rustâ€™s ecosystem for web development, including libraries like [Hyper](https://hyper.rs/), [Warp](https://docs.rs/warp/latest/warp/), or [Actix](https://actix.rs/), and will focus on writing performant, safe, and maintainable code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To contribute, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (latest stable version)
- [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) (Rustâ€™s package manager)
- A text editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) with Rust plugin

### Setting Up

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rust-web-server-project.git
   cd rust-web-server-project
   ```

	2.	Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  cargo build
  ```


	3.	Run the server:
  ```bash
  cargo run
  ```


Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:
  ```bash
  /src                  // Main project source code
  /tests                // Unit and integration tests
  /Cargo.toml           // Rust project manifest
  /README.md            // This file!
  ```

As we build the project, this structure will grow with more routes, middlewares, database configurations, etc.

Contribution Guidelines

	1.	Focus on Learning: Our goal is to learn web development in Rust together. If something is unclear or if youâ€™re stuck, ask questions! We encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing among team members.
	2.	No AI Tools Allowed: This is an educational project, so we ask that contributors do not use any AI-powered code generation tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT). Writing and debugging the code yourself is crucial to learning. If you hit a roadblock, refer to the official documentation, our discussion channels, or ask for help from the team.
	3.	Branching Workflow: We are using a branch-based workflow for collaboration. Hereâ€™s how to contribute:
	â€¢	Create a new branch for each feature or bugfix:

git checkout -b feature-name


	â€¢	Once the feature is complete, push your branch:
  ```bash
  git push origin feature-name
  ```

	â€¢	Open a pull request (PR) from your branch to the main branch for review.
	â€¢	Code reviews will be done by other team members before merging into main.

	4.	Write Idiomatic Rust: Aim to write idiomatic Rust code, following best practices. Ensure that your code is clean, maintainable, and efficient. We will be reviewing each otherâ€™s code and making improvements as a team.
	5.	Documentation: Write clear comments and documentation, especially for complex logic. Document any APIs you create or important parts of the web server.
	6.	Testing: Ensure that your contributions include tests, whether unit tests for small components or integration tests for complete routes or modules. The goal is to maintain high code quality.
	7.	Code Reviews:
	â€¢	All PRs require at least one other team member to review them.
	â€¢	Respond to comments and suggestions from your reviewers, and implement necessary changes.
	â€¢	The main branch should always contain stable, functional code.

Project Workflow

	â€¢	Main Branch: The main branch is considered stable and production-ready.
	â€¢	Feature Branches: Every new feature or bugfix must be developed on a separate branch. Once it is ready and reviewed, it will be merged into the main branch.

Resources for Learning

Here are some resources to help you learn Rust and web development without using AI tools:

	â€¢	The Rust Programming Language Book
	â€¢	Rust Web Development with Actix
	â€¢	Warp Web Framework Documentation
	â€¢	Hyper Web Framework Documentation
	â€¢	Rust Async Programming

Communication

We will use [Discord/Slack/Email] (whichever platform is applicable) to communicate about progress, discuss issues, and help each other out. Please be active and check in regularly.

Weâ€™re excited to have you on board and look forward to building this Rust web server together! Letâ€™s make the most of this learning opportunity and grow as developers.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
